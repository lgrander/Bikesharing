This analysis determines the summary overview for CitiBike data. CitiBike is a bicycle sharing system in New York City, NY. Data for analysis was collected from the month of August. August was chosen for its moderate weather. The analysis results will be utilized by investors to determine if investing an a CitiBike chapter in Des Moines, IA is a lucrative venture. Final visualizations of the analysis were prepared using Tableau Public tool.

## Results
Let's have a look on the results of the overview of CitiBike data below. 

There were more than 2 million trips in August with CitiBike. From the above Tableau map we can see that top starting and ending locations are similar and located in Manhattan - the main touristic and business center in NYC.

In the Dashboard above we can see the total number of trips and well and some user information. 81% of users are annual subscribers, only 19% of all rides were booked by non-subscribers. This Suggest that a very small percentage of utilization is dependent upon tourism.

Based on the peak hours and ride duration above we can see that most of the utilization is for short rides during peak traffic hours. We can assume from this information that it is mostly locals using the bikes. This is further broken down by the utilization hot map below.

## Summary 

Although population of Des Moines is not that high as Manhattan - it is growing every year bringing more and more potential customers. This is a plus for a new business - it is not required to have that huge park of bicycles in the beginning and also it will require less maintenance. So, it won't require huge investments to start the business.
Two additional visualization I would suggest would be something reflecting cost and profit. 
The second visualization would be average maintenance cost relative to usage so that we can predict how much maintenance would need to be preformed and the cost of the maintenance.
